# Triviality !heading

Dependency Injection is all about code reusability. 
Itâ€™s a design pattern aiming to make high-level code reusable, 
by separating the object creation / configuration from usage. **Triviality** highly aims to keep away from your application code. 
**No magic** injection with tokens, annotations whatsoever. It will use your application code 
as **strictly typed interface** to assure everything is connected properly. 

Triviality by core is split into Modules. A module is defined as a class. Each module has his own services definitions 
so each module can serve it's unique and there separate logic.

#typescript "example/module/LogModule.ts"

As you can see a module class has functions on them. The function name is the service name. The function implementation the service factory. Before we can call the service from the container
we need to build it:

#typescript "example/module/LogModuleContainer.ts"

Now we can fetch the 'logger' service from the container and start using it. This service will be a singleton based on the service factory arguments.

#typescript "example/singleton/LogModule.ts"

The logger service function and the 'prefixedLoggerService' functions will always return the same instance for the same arguments. 

#typescript "example/singleton/LogModuleContainer.ts"

The container service function types are directly copied from the Modules.
This gives typescript the option to **strictly type check** if everything is connected properly. 
And you the benefits of **code completion** and the option to quickly traverse to the service chain.

Let's put the type checking to the test, we create a nice module that use the 'LogModule'.

#typescript "example/moduleDependency/HalloModule.ts"

The container:

#typescript "example/moduleDependency/HalloModuleErrorContainer.ts.example"

If you forget a module you see a nice error of typescript in your IDE.

![alt text](./../example/moduleDependency/HalloModuleErrorContainer.png "Module requirement error")

    Error:(6, 8) TS2345: Argument of type 'typeof HalloModule' is not assignable to parameter of type 'ModuleConstructor<HalloModule, {}>'.
      Types of parameters 'container' and 'container' are incompatible.
        Property 'logger' is missing in type '{}' but required in type 'Readonly<Pick<LogModule, "logger">>'.

Let's fix the error with:

#typescript "example/moduleDependency/HalloModuleContainer.ts"
